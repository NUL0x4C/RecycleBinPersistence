# RecycleBinPersistence, using the Recycle Bin to insure persistence


#### this poc will execute calc.exe whenever the user tries to open the recycle bin.

#### at the time of writing the poc, there was no actual code on it, just a paper discussing the registery keys required to do the job, however at the moment of publishing, going back to the sources to add a reference i have found that a poc was already published at [vx-underground](https://papers.vx-underground.org/papers/Windows/Persistence/Persistence%20via%20Recycle%20Bin.7z), anyways thats mine. Note that there was time windows allowed editing these registery keys without privileges needed (before a certain update), but thats not the case now, so in order to run this code you need to have permissions to do so.
